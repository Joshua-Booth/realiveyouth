### The Manual

The Equipped Youth Manual is an online resource for helping young Christians to live, serve and share their faith with others.

This website and web application is primarily designed for members of the Realive Youth group.

### Realive Youth

Realive Youth is a youth group for 14 year olds through to mid 20's and is held every Saturday night at 7pm in the church gymnasium.   

It's a place where teens can meet with their peers and have some fun and also spend time talking about God, singing, looking into God's Word and learning what it means to be a Christian.
