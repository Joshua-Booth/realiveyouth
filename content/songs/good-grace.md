  People come together Strangers, neighbours Our blood is one Children of
  generations Of every nation Of kingdom come So don't let your heart be
  troubled Hold your head up high Don't fear no evil Fix your eyes on this one
  truth God is madly in love with you So take courage Hold on, be strong
  Remember where our help comes from Jesus, our redemption Our salvation is in
  His blood Jesus, light of heaven Friend forever, His kingdom come So don't let
  your heart be troubled Hold your head up high Don't fear no evil Fix your eyes
  on this one truth God is madly in love with you So take courage Hold on, be
  strong Remember where our help comes from Swing wide All you heavens Let the
  praise go up As the walls come down All creation Everything with breath Repeat
  the sound All His children Clean hands, pure hearts Good grace, good God His
  name is Jesus Swing wide All you heavens Let the praise go up As the walls
  come down All creation Everything with breath Repeat the sound All His
  children Clean hands, pure hearts Good grace, good God His name is Jesus Swing
  wide All you heavens Let the praise go up As the walls come down All creation
  Everything with breath Repeat the sound All His children Clean hands, pure
  hearts Good grace, good God His name is Jesus Swing wide All you heavens Let
  the praise go up As the walls come down All creation Everything with breath
  Repeat the sound All His children Clean hands, pure hearts Good grace, good
  God His name is Jesus Jesus, our redemption Our salvation is in His blood
  Jesus, light of heaven Friend forever, His kingdom come
