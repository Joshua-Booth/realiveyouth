Pray and ask God to give you the right words to say and to show you the best time to say them. Then explain the simple good news of salvation. Here are some tips.

First, people need to understand that they are sinners. Many people think that all they have to do to get into heaven is live a good life and try to be nice to others. The problem is that every person on earth has sinned (done wrong things that God has said not to do), and sinners can never be allowed into heaven. The person youâ€™re talking to needs to understand that they have broken God's law and can't get into heaven on their own.

Next, tell them the good news! God made a way for us to get to heaven when He sent His Son, Jesus, to earth. Jesus is the only person who has never sinned; He is perfect. So He was the only one who could take the punishment for our sin, which He did by dying on the cross. Three days later, He came back to life, showing us His great power. The only way to get to heaven is to turn away from our sin and trust Jesus to save us.

You can also tell people about the difference Jesus has made in your life, and the hope and peace you have because of Him. This is often called a personal testimony.

God has commanded us to tell others about Him, because He wants everyone to be with Him in heaven forever (2 Peter 3:9). We can't save anyone...that's God's job. But our job is to make sure that as many people as possible find out about trusting Jesus for salvation!
