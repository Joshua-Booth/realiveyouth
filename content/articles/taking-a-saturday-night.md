The team will be made up of the following: 

* Supervisor - responsible for overseeing the planning and supervising the night 
* SLT Team Leader - Organises the team to plan and execute the night 
* Team of helpers - Provide ideas and input into planning and running the night and running it on the night

## Responsibilities

* As a member of our Youth group you are needed to help out once and while with taking a night 
* You will be given a roster and sufficient notice of the night you're on 
* If you can't make it, you need to find a replacement and you need to let your supervisor know. 

## Planning

* Decide on your night’s theme and format of the night 
* Start completing planning template and consider details like:   
  * How to introduce the night (think if there is a different way to start the night i.e. Video, power point, a skit, abseiling etc)
  * Team organisation e.g. pairing up, lining up and numbering off
  * How many teams and what is the minimum required per team
  * What happens if you get a small turn out
  * How scoring will be done 
  * Do you need prizes (see budget section below) 
  * How round changes will be done and who is responsible 
  * Is there music and video involved? Are they appropriate?
  * Are any of the activities dangerous and may need a backup plan if they are not appropriate?
  * Do you need a Viber message sent to let everyone know about the night? 
  * What is your wet weather plan? 
  * Find out if there is supper on the night you are running so you can make sure you don’t run out of time for your activities. Contact Martin Varney well in advance if supper is needed.
  * If the no 3 flat garage needs to be accessed you must knock on the door and let them know beforehand.  
  * You must go through the main office when putting flyers/notices regarding YG on the main church notice board  

## Approval

You need to get approval for the night before you start

* Complete and email plan of night to supervisor in charge (Please use template provided)
* Make sure you send it through well before the night so if they are any issues there is plenty of time to resolve them.

## On the Night

* Be setup and ready to go by 6:30pm  
* Meet together with your team for prayer prior to youth arriving at 7pm
* Be visible from 7pm as people arrive and welcome people as they arrive
* Games start at 7.15pm sharp

## Running the Night

* Think about organising a microphone if you are a quiet talker 
* When your team begins the night make sure everyone is attentive and listening before you start.  
* If you are not getting the attention you need get one of the leaders to help. 
* Be definite about the rules and stick to them. Don't to get caught up in referee disputes with youth group members.  
* If you think you might need some help grab one of the leaders.  

## Finishing the Night

* Games need to finish at 8.30pm sharp unless there is no supper. If there is no supper you can run until 8.40pm at the latest.
* As you are closing the activities, encourage Youth Group to move through to the gym to begin setting up Asian Church.  

## Budget

* Historically we don't give financial assistance for games or prizes on every night.
* We are more likely to agree to providing financial assistance for special nights on the calendar and not normal nights e.g. friends nights. However you can request financial assistance on any night but there has to be a good reason.
* Generally basic prizes should be covered by the team running the night e.g. everyone pitch in $2 to get some chocolate or drinks. 
* If there is cost involved in running the night then your team will need to get a budget approval first and depending on how much is required they will need approval from different people: 
  * Up to $30 is covered by the supervisor on the night 
  * $31-$60 needs to go to Brendan at the moment
  * $61 or over needs to go to Brendan or Michelle 
* Before anyone gets approval the team needs to give a detailed breakdown of the what the money is for. This includes: 
  * Breakdown of exactly what is being purchased 
  * Cost of each component 
  * Why they need it. 
* When requesting budget ask yourself these questions: 
  * Do we have those resources already in the youth cupboard 
  * Can you get it cheaper somewhere else 
  * Do you really need to spend this amount to make the night better or can the game be adjusted 
* You will not be reimbursed anything unless you have been given approval first. Anything over what was approved will need to be covered by your team, unless you have requested the budget to be increased and that increase is approved.
