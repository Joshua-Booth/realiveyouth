God is a loving God however ‘loving’ does not mean that God does not care about right and wrong. His love includes justice and fairness. It is just and fair that the wicked are punished. For example, we expect God to punish bad people like Hitler etc. In fact, we would be offended if God does not act to punish the wicked! 

However, all humans as a race are under judgement for being wicked (Romans 3:23). Now, that does not mean that we necessarily do evil all the time but the fact that we do do some evil some of the time makes us guilty before God. Yet, despite our wickedness, God indeed shows His love. Through Jesus’ death, God lovingly rescues people from hell. That’s a great offer if you are not rescued already!
