Pray and ask God to give you the right words to say and to show you the best time to say them. Then explain the simple good news of salvation. Here are some tips.

First, people need to understand that they are sinners. Many people think that all they have to do to get into heaven is live a good life and try to be nice to others. The problem is that every person on earth has sinned (done wrong things that God has said not to do), and sinners can never be allowed into heaven. The person youâ€™re talking to needs to understand that they have broken God's law and can't get into heaven on their own.
